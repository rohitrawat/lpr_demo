# LPR Demo

This is an online demo for the LPR software I have written. 
The online demo is a NodeJS app that uploads an image from a browser (from a PC or a mobile camera) and runs the LPR executable on it.
The LPR executable is compiled from C++ code and is not a part of the repository.
The app generates a basic page with the results and intermediary images.
Also included is a the upload page that provides instructions and some sample images to work with.
